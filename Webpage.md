#### Group Roles:

We made the decision not to assign "roles" and everyone is expected to contribute equally to the groups success and be a leader when needed.

---

### Group Meetings:

We have decided to meet irregularly, and communicate via group message on an as-needed basis. We use an agile-like format and will use Jira to schedule and communicate tasks.

#### Upcoming Meetings

Our pre-presentation meeting is on Feb 18th, in which we will rehearse our presentation and make sure all the deliverables for Stage 1 are ready.

There will also be a meeting after the presentation to align on the engineering, and wrap up the remaining implementation details. (Not yet scheduled)

#### Past Meetings

Our initial meeting was on Jan 30th, in which we planned and discussed the project. After this meeting the following was accomplished:

- Created and scaffolded our Github Repo and Organization.
- Created the base for our powerpoint presentation.
- Created the base for our our IEEE proposal document.
- Setup and joined Jira.
